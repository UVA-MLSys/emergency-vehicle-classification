# emergency-vehicle-classification

We used the Emergency Vehicles Identification Kaggle Dataset linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhisheksinghblr/emergency-vehicles-identification
please download this dataset prior to attempting to run the codebase.

This code was configured so that no code needs to be changed based on any system as long as the downloaded dataset
is on the same path as the program (os.join.path)

It is recommended that you run this code on dedicated GPUs.
